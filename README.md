# Reluctance-Motor

This project is dedicated to the design and analysis of Synchronous Reluctance Motors (SyRM) using a combination of Python, FEMM, and a genetic algorithm for optimization.

## Project Goal

Synchronous reluctance machines are a very promising solution to the concerns surrounding the use of rare-earth elements in electric motors. This project aims to create a tool that builds a preliminary model of a Synchronous Reluctance Machine using the open-source software FEMM, with the process automated and optimized by Python scripts and a genetic algorithm.

This is a work in progress, and anyone is welcome to help and contribute to the development of the project.

## Background

I started this as my college project and was able to achieve a preliminary design. During that phase, the initial motor was developed using an analytical tool, but the optimization was completed using other proprietary FEA software due to time constraints.

Now, I am looking forward to building a complete, end-to-end open-source solution for SyRM design and analysis.
